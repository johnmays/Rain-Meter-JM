This repository is for all of my custom Honeycomb Content
My Desktop is bichromal, so I've created my own icons as well as edited some defaults to be black & white.
I have also created some of my own .ino files, the init sequences for some of these apps were difficult to find, especially GitHub Desktop. (filePath: "C:\Users\John Mays\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\R53ZGN70.2JY\WQL594TZ.M4Q\gith..tion_317444273a93ac29_0003.0003_5794af8169eeff14\GitHub.exe")
How was I supposed to figure that out?
